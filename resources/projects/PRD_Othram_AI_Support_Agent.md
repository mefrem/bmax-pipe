# Product Requirements Document: AI Support Agent

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** November 2024  
**Type:** Challenger Project

## Executive Summary

Build an AI-powered customer support agent that handles incoming inquiries through Zendesk or email, provides accurate responses based on company knowledge, and escalates to humans only when necessary. The primary goal is maximizing autonomous resolution rate.

## Core Objectives

- Automatically respond to customer inquiries via Zendesk/email
- Provide accurate information from company knowledge and case systems
- Resolve straightforward questions without human intervention
- Recognize when issues require human expertise and escalate appropriately
- Integrate seamlessly with existing Zendesk infrastructure

## Key Features

### 1. Zendesk Integration

Monitor incoming tickets, automatically respond to appropriate ones, escalate when needed, maintain ticket history and threading.

### 2. Common Question Automation

Handle without human intervention:

- Case status checks ('I sent case last Thursday, where am I?')
- Permission requests ('Can I use this photo?' - always yes)
- Process questions
- Documentation requests
- General information

### 3. Information Access

- Query case management system for real-time status
- Access knowledge base for policies/procedures
- Never hallucinate information
- Provide accurate timelines from actual data

### 4. Escalation Intelligence

Escalate when:

- Issue is complex
- Falls outside standard procedures
- Customer is frustrated
- Involves billing disputes
- Technical problems identified
- Customer requests human
- System confidence is low

## Success Metrics

**Primary metric:** Human avoidance rate - percentage of tickets resolved without escalation.

| Metric                | Target/Goal                          |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Resolution Rate       | Maximize autonomous resolutions      |
| Response Time         | Under 5 minutes from ticket creation |
| Customer Satisfaction | Match or exceed human baseline       |
| Response Accuracy     | 100% - zero hallucinations           |

## Example Use Cases

### Case Status (No Escalation)

Customer asks 'Where am I at?', system queries case database, finds case submitted last Thursday, responds 'Currently scheduled for sequencing in 2 weeks, complete in 3 weeks total', marks ticket solved.

### Permission Request (No Escalation)

Customer asks about using case photo in article, system checks policy (always grant permission), responds 'Yes, you have permission', ticket solved. Previously required human time - now instant and automated.

### Complex Issue (Escalation)

Customer reports DNA profile doesn't match expectations and needs reprocessing discussion, system recognizes technical complexity, acknowledges concern, escalates to technical team with context, notifies customer specialist will follow up.

### Off-Topic (Boundary)

Customer asks 'Help me write a grant proposal', system identifies as out of scope, politely redirects: 'I'm here for case-related questions. For grant writing, consult a specialist', offers service-related help instead.

## Technical Considerations

### Zendesk API

- Use webhooks or polling for ticket monitoring
- Comprehensive APIs for ticket CRUD and comments
- Respect rate limits

### Knowledge Base

- Structured access to SOPs, policies, case timelines, service descriptions
- Consider vector database for retrieval

### Case System Integration

- Real-time access to case status and processing stages
- Proper error handling for missing cases

### Staying On Scope

- Like AI SDR, must stay focused on customer service topics
- Implement conversation boundaries and topic classification

## Zendesk Features to Leverage

- Automatic ticket creation from multiple channels (email, web form)
- Routing rules for assigning tickets to agents/groups
- Macros for common responses (AI can trigger these)
- Tags for categorization and filtering
- Internal notes for escalation context
- Webhooks for real-time notifications
- Customer history access for previous interactions

## Key Challenges

- **Accuracy Requirements:** Zero tolerance for hallucinations about case status
- **Escalation Balance:** Not too often, not too rarely
- **Context Understanding:** Parse unclear or poorly worded questions
- **System Integration:** Reliable connections to case management and knowledge systems
- **Data Freshness:** Ensure case status information is current

## Evaluation Criteria

- Resolution rate - ability to handle inquiries without escalation
- Response accuracy and relevance
- Proper use of Zendesk APIs and features
- Appropriate escalation judgment (complex vs. simple)
- Code quality, error handling, architecture
- Knowledge base design and information access
- Demonstration of various scenarios and edge cases

## Additional Notes

**Universal Skills:** Customer support automation applies to any company with inquiries at scale.

**Internal Potential:** Same system adaptable for internal employee support.

**Human Labor Savings:** Every autonomous resolution frees agents for truly complex issues - goal is removing operational humans from routine processes.

**Foundation:** Success creates foundation for broader operational automation.
