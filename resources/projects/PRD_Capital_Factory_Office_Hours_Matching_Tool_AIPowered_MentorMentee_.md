# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Executive Summary

The Office Hours Matching Tool is an AI-Powered Mentor-Mentee Platform designed to streamline and optimize the connection process between startup founders and subject matter experts at Capital Factory. By leveraging AI for intelligent matching, the platform aims to enhance the user experience, improve mentor utilization, and increase the efficiency of mentorship connections. This tool directly supports Capital Factory's mission as an accelerator by facilitating timely and relevant mentorship, which is crucial for startup success.

## 2. Problem Statement

Capital Factory's current Union.vc platform presents several challenges: manual profile creation, lack of intelligent matching, reliance on surveys for feedback, and inefficient mentor utilization. These issues lead to suboptimal matches, underutilized mentor time slots (below 75% utilization), and a poor user experience that hinders meaningful mentorship connections. An automated, intelligent solution is required to eliminate manual data entry, provide passive reputation tracking, and use AI to match founders with mentors based on expertise, industry, stage, and availability.

## 3. Goals & Success Metrics

- **Mentor Utilization Rate**: Increase mentor utilization to above 90%.
- **Platform Activity Growth**: Achieve a 30% increase in booked sessions within six months post-launch.
- **Engagement Distribution**: Ensure even distribution of mentor engagements across various expertise areas.
- **Session Quality**: Improve session feedback scores to an average of 4.5 out of 5.
- **Adoption Rate**: Achieve a 70% adoption rate by existing mentors and mentees within the first quarter post-launch.

## 4. Target Users & Personas

- **Startup Founders (Mentees)**: Require quick and easy access to mentors with relevant expertise to guide them through various stages of startup development.
- **Subject Matter Experts (Mentors)**: Seek efficient utilization of their time through meaningful engagements with startups that align with their expertise.
- **Program Managers**: Need a streamlined system to manage and optimize mentor-mentee connections and track session effectiveness.

## 5. User Stories
