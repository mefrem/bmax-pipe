# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Executive Summary

Frontier Audio is developing an "Always-On Selective Speaker Android App With Cloud Transcription" aimed at enhancing productivity and safety for frontline workers. This Android app ensures continuous, high-quality transcription of conversations, selectively capturing only the primary user's speech. The transcriptions, equipped with time stamps and geographical data, are securely stored in the cloud, seamlessly integrating with Frontier's AI assistant capabilities. This tool empowers workers by providing an accurate record of daily discussions, crucial for technical and legal purposes, while boosting productivity and ensuring precise recall of information.

## 2. Problem Statement

Frontline workers and supervisors often engage in numerous critical conversations in challenging environments. Remembering every detail is impractical. A reliable, frictionless transcription solution is needed to capture conversations without manual intervention, focusing only on the primary user's speech to respect privacy and legal considerations.

## 3. Goals & Success Metrics

### Goals
- Develop an always-on, selective speaker transcription app
- Ensure high-quality, timely transcriptions
- Integrate transcription data into Frontier's AI ecosystem

### Success Metrics
- Increase in frontline worker productivity by 20%
- Reduction in recall-related errors by 30%
- Zero instances of unauthorized speech in transcriptions
- Achieve a Word Error Rate (WER) below 5%

## 4. Target Users & Personas

### Target Users
- **Frontline Workers**: Need a reliable method to record and access conversations to improve work efficiency.
- **Supervisors/Managers**: Require accurate records of discussions for decision-making and reporting.

### Personas
- **John, Construction Supervisor**: Needs to ensure all technical discussions are recorded accurately for project documentation.
- **Sarah, Field Technician**: Requires precise notes of client interactions to enhance service delivery.

## 5. User Stories

1. As a frontline worker, I want the app to automatically start transcribing once set up so that I don't have to manually activate it every day.
2. As a supervisor, I want the app to only transcribe my voice so that I maintain privacy and comply with legal standards.
3. As a field technician, I want GPS data included with my transcriptions so that I can reference where each conversation took place.

## 6. Functional Requirements

### P0: Must-have
1. The app continuously transcribes speech when permissions are granted, unaffected by other device activities.
2. Speaker verification ensures only the primary user's speech is transcribed.
3. Transcriptions are high-quality, timestamped, and stored in the cloud.

### P1: Should-have
4. Transcription data includes GPS location information.
5. Bluetooth microphone support, switching seamlessly between device and Bluetooth inputs.

### P2: Nice-to-have
6. Integration with Frontier's AI assistant for enhanced data analysis and insights.

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Ensure continuous operation over a 24-hour period without interruptions.
- **Security**: Implement robust data encryption for transcriptions stored and transmitted.
- **Scalability**: Support scaling to millions of users without degradation in performance.
- **Compliance**: Adhere to privacy laws and regulations regarding speech data.

## 8. User Experience & Design Considerations

- **Interface**: Simple setup process with minimal user interaction required after initial setup.
- **Accessibility**: Support for voice commands to configure settings.
- **Workflows**: Seamless integration with existing workflows to avoid disruptions.

## 9. Technical Requirements

- **System Architecture**: Android app built using Kotlin, integrating with a cloud-based transcription service.
- **Integrations**: Use publicly available AI frameworks for speaker verification and transcription.
- **APIs/Data**: Utilize open-source libraries for GPS integration and audio processing.

## 10. Dependencies & Assumptions

- Reliable internet connectivity for cloud transcription.
- Device permissions granted for continuous operation.
- Users undergo a one-time voice enrollment process.

## 11. Out of Scope

- Transcription of conversations involving multiple users.
- Support for non-Android platforms.
- Advanced AI analysis beyond basic transcription correction.

This PRD outlines the critical elements required to build an "Always-On Selective Speaker Android App With Cloud Transcription," ensuring a comprehensive solution that meets the needs of frontline workers while enhancing productivity and safety.
