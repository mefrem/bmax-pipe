# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Intelligent Content Detection in Photos

## 1. Executive Summary

**Product/Feature Name**: Intelligent Content Detection in Photos  
**Organization**: CompanyCam  
**Category**: AI Solution  

**Overview**:  
The Intelligent Content Detection in Photos feature leverages AI technology to automatically identify and tag content in photos captured by contractors. This turns raw images into structured, actionable data, streamlining workflows such as insurance claims, material verification, and resource estimation. By automating identification, tagging, and highlighting relevant photo content, CompanyCam can enhance efficiency and accuracy in job documentation processes.

## 2. Problem Statement

Contractors are increasingly reliant on photos to track job progress, capture damage, and manage materials. However, identifying and tagging content within these photos remains a manual and time-consuming process. This manual effort hinders workflows, particularly in tasks like submitting insurance claims, verifying deliveries, and estimating material requirements. Automating these processes presents a significant opportunity to improve productivity and accuracy.

## 3. Goals & Success Metrics

**Goals**:
- Automate content detection and tagging in photos to reduce manual effort.
- Improve accuracy in damage identification and material verification processes.
- Enable real-time feedback and structured data generation from photos.

**Success Metrics**:
- **Damage Detection Accuracy**: Achieve high precision and recall for detecting known damage types.
- **Time to Tag**: 90% of photos enriched with tags in less than 500ms.
- **Material Count Accuracy**: Achieve a high correlation between AI-detected counts and user confirmation.
- **Sizing Estimate Accuracy**: Align AI estimates with manual input or known orders.
- **Increased Usage**: Boost the number of photos used in insurance reports, verified delivery photos, and estimating workflows initiated from photos.

## 4. Target Users & Personas

**Primary Users**:
- **Contractors**: Need quick and accurate identification of damage and materials to streamline job documentation and reporting processes.
- **Insurance Adjusters**: Require precise damage identification and reporting for efficient claims processing.
- **Project Managers**: Seek accurate material counts and estimates for effective planning and resource allocation.

**Personas**:
- **Sam, the Contractor**: Frequently documents job sites and needs to quickly identify damage and materials to keep projects on track.
- **Alex, the Insurance Adjuster**: Relies on accurate damage reports to expedite claims processing.
- **Pat, the Project Manager**: Needs reliable data on material usage and delivery confirmations to maintain project timelines and budgets.

## 5. User Stories

1. **As a Contractor**, I want the system to automatically identify and tag roof damage in photos so that I can quickly generate insurance reports.
2. **As an Insurance Adjuster**, I want photos tagged with damage types and severity so that I can expedite claims processing.
3. **As a Project Manager**, I want the system to confirm material deliveries and provide quantity estimates so that I can verify orders and manage resources effectively.

## 6. Functional Requirements

### P0: Must-have (Critical)

- **Damage Identification on Roofs**:
  - Detect and classify roof damage types such as hail impact, wind/storm damage, and missing shingles.
  - Highlight damaged areas on photos using bounding boxes or segmentation masks.
  - Auto-tag photos with damage type and severity.
  - Support export or report generation for insurance documentation.

- **Material Delivery Confirmation**:
  - Detect delivered materials such as shingles and plywood.
  - Count identifiable units and tag photos with material type, brand, and quantity.
  - Alert users if quantities appear less than expected.

### P1: Should-have (Important)

- **Loose Material Sizing**:
  - Detect and estimate volumes of loose materials like gravel and mulch.
  - Use object scale estimation and depth data for cubic yardage approximation.
  - Prompt users to confirm or refine volume estimates.

- **Core Capabilities**:
  - Real-time object and material detection at photo capture.
  - Auto-tagging by category and storing structured metadata.

### P2: Nice-to-have (Optional)

- **AI-Native Opportunities**:
  - Build feedback loops from confirmed insurance reports and delivery confirmations.
  - Pre-fill claims or job reports with detected photos and structured content.

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Low latency with photo processing time under 500ms.
- **Security**: Ensure data privacy and protection in compliance with industry standards.
- **Scalability**: Capable of handling increased photo volumes without degradation in performance.
- **Compliance**: Adhere to relevant regulations and standards (e.g., GDPR for data handling).

## 8. User Experience & Design Considerations

- **Interface Principles**: Ensure a user-friendly interface with intuitive tagging and highlighting features.
- **Accessibility Needs**: Design for diverse users, including those with disabilities, ensuring clear visual markers and accessible prompts.
- **Key Workflows**: Streamlined photo capture and tagging process with minimal user intervention required.

## 9. Technical Requirements

- **System Architecture**: Utilize a combination of on-device processing and cloud inference for complex tasks.
- **Integrations**: Support for open-source AI frameworks and publicly available APIs for detection models.
- **Data Requirements**: Use mock data sources for training models, with a focus on roofing-specific imagery and known object references.

## 10. Dependencies & Assumptions

- Assume availability of domain-specific training data for model development.
- Dependence on cloud platforms for complex AI processing when on-device capabilities are insufficient.
- Assume user devices support the necessary hardware capabilities for real-time detection.

## 11. Out of Scope

- Full automation of claims submission processes.
- Integration with proprietary insurance software systems.
- Real-time 3D modeling or reconstruction of job sites.
